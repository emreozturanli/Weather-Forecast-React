# Weather Forecast with React

[See the page](https://weather-forecast-api-react.vercel.app/)

- I made a daily weather forecast app with React. 
- In this app I get the data from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) API using <b>axios</b>
- User can search for the city to learn its daily weather forecast.


### I used;
  - <b>Components</b>
  - <b>useState</b>
  - <b>useEffect</b>
  - <b>axios</b>
  - import/export
  - <b>Props</b>
  - React <b>Developer Tool</b>
  - Destructuring props
  - array <b>map</b> method
